For a 3D CT scan volume, the three axes are typically referred to as:

Axial (or transverse)
Coronal (or frontal)
Sagittal

Given the shape (100, 200, 300), these dimensions usually correspond to:

100: Number of slices in the axial plane
200: Number of rows in the coronal plane
300: Number of columns in the sagittal plane

The orientations are typically:

Axial: Top to bottom view (looking from above)
Coronal: Front to back view
Sagittal: Side to side view (left to right)
